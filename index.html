    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For Verifiable Credentials to be realized as a usable data format there needs to exist a neutral, 
        standard-governed way for Issuers, Holders and Verifiers of these credentials to transport them between said entities.

      <h3>Get Digital Permanent Resident Card</h3>
      <p>Lana is an IT administrator for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 
        Digital Permanent Resident Card (PRC) program. She configures the USCIS website to issue digital 
        Permanent Resident Cards by utilizing industry standard issuer software and setting up the appropriate 
        HTTP API Authorizations between systems. Legal Permanent Residents, upon receiving their physical card 
        in the mail, are given the USCIS website URL, a login account, and PIN code that they may use to manage 
        their account and pick up their digital Permanent Resident Card. When Louis, a Legal Permanent Resident, 
        requests a digital Permanent Resident Card via the USCIS website, he authenticates using his login account 
        and once authenticated, provides a DID associated with his client-side digital wallet against which the 
        website will issue VCs. The USCIS website then connects to the digital card issuing server, which builds 
        the Verifiable Credential Permanent Resident Card using Louis' account data, and then utilizes industry 
        standard HTTP APIs to issue the Permanent Resident Card as a Verifiable Credential. Louis can then use his 
        Digital Permanent Resident Card in online scenarios when he needs to prove his resident status, such as 
        when applying for a job.</p>

      <h3>Execute Multi-stage Presentation Workflow</h3>
      <p>Description: Ignio, a logistics manager for "Kirk Company", would like to submit all necessary paperwork 
        to send his company's products across international boundaries. These products are considered hazardous 
        chemicals and thus are regulated, requiring extra paperwork to be filed before transportation is approved 
        across boundaries. Some hazardous material shipments are different resulting in different required paperwork, 
        and Ignio wants to automate as much of the process as possible with Shippers, 
        their 3rd Party Logistics company (3PL). There are a set of verifiable credentials that Ignio is willing to 
        share with Customs as well as the transportation company. 
      </p>
      <p>When Kirk starts a shipping workflow, his company's systems initiate the workflow by contacting a known 
        location on the Shipper's Website. A presentation exchange occurs to first DIDAuth the company and send 
        generic mandatory information for any shipment; if and only if the information provided requires additional 
        information‒in this case a hazmat certification‒a second exchange is initiated to request this outstanding/required 
        hazmat info.  Once this is received, Shippers can send back a Bill of Lading in VC form. The two (or more) 
        credential exchanges are composable and idempotent, ending in a valid BoL if successful.
      </p>

      <h3>Aggregated Credential Workflow</h3>
      <p>Tod is using digital credentials to apply for a service/qualify for a job/gain access to a programme. 
        Some of his credentials are available today, some will need to be provided when they are ready 
        (for example, a criminal background check can take 24-48 hrs to process). He would like these credentials to 
        be presented to the Verifier (service provider) when ready, without having to constantly return to the Verifier 
        (service provider) and deliver them "by hand". He should be able to have them released from his Holder directly 
        as they become available.</p>
        <p><b>Requirements: </b><ul>
          <li>X. Verifiable Presentation by policy, </li>

      <h3>Submit/Sign/Verify a test credential to a licensure system</h3>
      <p>A student, Shabazz, wants to publish their MBLEx test results from an education test provider, 
        Massage Therapy Test Corp. Massage Therapy Test Corp proxies their authority to sign to a service provider, 
        SSI Ventures.  SSI Ventures issues Shabazz a VC when he logs into his Massage Therapy Test Corp account 
        and enables his browser-based SSI Wallet, Billfold.  The signed VC is then stored in Shabazz’ Billfold™ Wallet 
        to be presented elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>In a separate session, Shabazz logs into a web portal of a State Massage Therapy licensure system to 
        apply for his Massage Therapy license. The licensure specialist at the State checks the issuer using a 
        State accreditation system, then checks the signature on the test results VC and ingests the 
        credential’s payload. The licensure specialist then finalizes their workflow and issues 
        Shabazz a Massage Therapy license.

      <h3>Supply Chain Import</h3>
      <p>In order to export steel products to the global market, Steel Mills Global must prove 
        the quality of their products. For this, they rely on Inspectors & Co, an internationally 
        recognized steel testing company. Upon inspection, Inspectors & Co issues a 
        Mill Test Report VC to Steel Mills Global.</p>
      <p>Steel, Inc. imports and distributes steel products domestically. Negotiating a shipment 
        Steel Mills Global presents the MTR as proof of product quality. Steel Inc. verifies the
        MTR VP and accepts the shipment. </p>
      <p>Steel, Inc. initiates the importing procedures, starting out self-issuing an 
        Import Declaration Form VC. The MTR and IDF are jointly presented to the Customs 
        authority which verifies the VP. Upon verification the customs release is granted for goods import. </p>
        </p>
      <p><i>Note: These VC types are taken from the <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="">Traceability Vocabulary</a>, a W3C-CCG work item for supply chain use-cases.</i></p>
